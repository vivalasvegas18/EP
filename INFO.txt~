Once you have access to the EP resources, all documentation is stored in the folders S:\SILA-Commun\Projets\Trilogue
The e-Parliament Confluence pages are in http://www.evol2wiki.ep.parl.union.eu/wiki/display/eparliament/eParliament+Program
The JIRA project is TRILOEDIT
(I have ask for access in Confluence and JIRA but it may take a couple of days)
